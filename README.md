Dice Game / Craps Game

Rules-
  -Dice Roller alternates after current roller loses.
  -Whomever is the first to be the dice roller should roll both dice.
  -Add the total of the dice together to get your roll result. 
  -If the total value of the dice on the first roll is 7 or 11, the roller automatically wins.
  -If the total value of the dice on the first roll is 2,3, or 12, the roller automatically loses.
  -If the total value of the dice on the first roll is not 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12, then the value rolled is set as the Point.
  -The roller should roll the dice a second time, and add the totals together to have the current roll's result.
  -If this value matches the Point, the roller wins, the Point is cleared, and the roller starts over with a fresh First Roll.
  -If the value of the second roll does not match the Point, the value is added to the Point Tracker, and the roller should roll a third time.
  -If this third roll value is equal to the Point, the roller wins, and the roller starts over with a fresh First roll.
  -If this third roll value is not equal to the Point, but does match the 2nd roll value, the roller loses. The dice are then passed to the other player, who becomes the new Roller with a fresh First Roll 
  -If this third roll value is not equal to the Point, and is not equal to the value of the 2nd roll, the roller should roll a 4th time. 
  -Repeat this process until either the Point is rolled (resulting in a win for the roller) or a duplicate value is rolled (resulting in a loss for the roller).
